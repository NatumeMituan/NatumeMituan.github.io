It so happened that I found this article on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37118883): [AddyOsmani.com - Write about what you learn. It pushes you to understand topics better.](https://addyosmani.com/blog/write-learn/). According to the article, there are two benefits of writing:
1. Pushing us to better understand the topics we want to write about.
2. Helping us in building a habit of writing and refining our writing skills.

The article and the ensuing discussion made me think about starting to writing down my own learnings and thoughts. Perhaps it's also a good time to finally put into action my long-standing idea of "creating my own blog".

## Teaching is the best form of learning

The article reminds me of when I took notes for lectures in university. When I first entered university, I kept the habit of taking notes in class, which I've been doing in high school. But unlike high school, taking notes wasn't helping me much in university. At that time, I couldn't get the reason why the same learning method that worked well in high school failed when I entered university

Reflecting on this today, I might get two explanations:
1. In high school, teachers often share some "tips" that couldn't be found in textbooks or various reference books. Additionally, I was not in an environment where I can access learning resources from the internet during my high school days. Given that, the act of taking notes itself did have some value. However in university(at least for my major), what I could learn from the instructors in lectures often constituted only a part of the course. And there was a wealth of information available on the internet to supplement or even replace the lectures. Taking notes in class seemed to be valueless in such scenario.
2. What truly helped me in getting a not bad grade during high school might not have been the neatly taken class notes, but rather the classmates who turned to me with various questions. I might truly master the knowledge when I explained these subjects to others when trying to help them.

This may echo with the "Feynman Technique" mentioned in the aforementioned article. Taking notes in class is more an input process of recording without thinking. In contrast, responding to others' questions involves is more bout output. To make others understand a topic, we usually need to explain it in simple and comprehensive terms. Throughout the process, we discover many overlooked blind spots and gradually fill the gaps, deepening our understanding, until we can adeptly teach the topic to others. Writing can have a similar effect.

## The meaning of writing itself

In life, or perhaps more in work, writing is always a significantly important skill. For me at this moment, enhancing my English writing is also of great necessity, which is also the reason why I'm considering writing in both Chinese and English.

Beyond that, maybe we're always overlooking the inherent meaning of the act of writing. The satisfaction derived from producing something can not be replaced by the joy of consuming something. Coincidentally, a blogger I've been following posted a article several days ago about "why do we still need to write blog at the time of today"(in Chinese): [2023 年了你为什么需要写博客 | 椒盐豆豉](https://blog.douchi.space/2023-why-you-need-a-blog). This once agin reignited my thought to create my own blog.

## Just write, don't fear

In [the post on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37118883), there are several comments about fearing to writing: we often experience a worry: will sharing what I learned make me look stupid, if it's something many people already know about? There's another article mentioned in the comments which kind of responded to this worry: [Things I Don’t Know as of 2018 — Overreacted](https://overreacted.io/things-i-dont-know-as-of-2018/). No-one knows everything. Recognizing the limitations of one's knowledge and continuously learning is nothing to be shamed of.

One perspective in the comments also holds that there's already a plethora of content on various topics on the internet. Posting a new article might not likely bring much value, merely duplicating existing information. While this could indeed be the case, the lack of value to the internet doesn't necessarily imply a lack of value to the writer, which has been discussed above. Besides, even if it's merely information duplication, shouldn't it still hold some value?

For the fool one, writing down their journey of learning should be encouraged, at least by oneself.
